```

### 2. Customizing Notifications
Edit the ECA model to customize notification behavior:

```yaml
# In eca.eca.news_editorial_workflow.yml
events:
  content_moderation_state_change:
    conditions:
      - workflow_id: basic_editorial
      - from_state: draft
      - to_state: in_review
    actions:
      - send_email:
          to: '[node:author:mail]'
          subject: 'Article submitted for review'
```

### 3. Adding Custom States
Extend the workflow by adding new states:

```yaml
# In workflows.workflow.basic_editorial.yml
type_settings:
  states:
    fact_check:
      label: 'Fact Check'
      weight: 3
  transitions:
    fact_check_to_review:
      from: [fact_check]
      to: in_review
```
